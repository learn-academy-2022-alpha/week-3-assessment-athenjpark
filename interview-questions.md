# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: `this` is a keyword in JavaScript that refers to the elements of an object when referring to itself.

  Researched answer: `this` is a keyword in JavaScript that references the object and can be used to declare a variable accessing the value within the object. In an object method, `this` refers to the object but if `this` is used alone, it refers to the global object.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is a JavaScript library that is responsible for creating user interfaces. This particular libary would be used since it is a crucial component for web development.

  Researched answer: React is used to build webpages, mobile web pages, and even native mobile applications. It is component based, which means that we use it to build many small parts, and then join them together to form entire applications. This turns out to be extremely scalable. It was created from Facebook as that application grew and became more dynamic.



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: The lifecycle method that is required in a React class component is the render() method.

  Researched answer: render() is the lifecycle method that is always required in a React class component. When the component is first put on the page, and every time something changes in our component, the render function runs automatically.



4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX stands for JavaScript XML which is essentially the fusion between JavaScript and HTML. One notable difference between HTML and JSX is that JSX allows the user to implement HTML markups within a JavaScript code block.

  Researched answer: JSX is JavaScript flavored HTML that behaves almost like HTML with a couple small exceptions -- most notably JSX uses the syntax className rather than HTML's class because class is reserved for HTML. One of the major differences between HTML and JSX is that in JSX, a single parent element must be returned.



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: App.js, src, and node modules are all modified in a React application when yarn is run.

  Researched answer: Yarn is a JavaScript package manager that creates the file structure of a React app and manages the dependencies.




6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Anonymous functions in JavaScript are functions that are not known.

  Researched answer: An anonymous function in JavaScript is a function without a name. They are often used as arguments for other functions.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

2. Props: Props (properties) is a keyword in React for passing information from one component to another.

3. JavaScript Events: HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

4. Object-oriented programming: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

5. Ruby: Ruby is a backend, object-oriented programming language.
